I have added my favorite projects over the last couple semesters and my expeirence from my current and previous job opportunities. Overall, you will learn a little about who I am and what my interests are. But for now, I welcome you to my basic HMTL/CSS project of me.

			This particular video was a short story project for the class, Communication Arts 467: Cinematography & Sound Recording. This was my very first time using the Panasonic Lumix GH5 camera to create my own story. <br><br> Our very first project was to create a silent short story. My short story is called Life of Kids that takes place in a home with two children. While one is searching under the pillows, couch, and blankets for something, we see another child take a toy that has been laying on the ground. As he plays with it, the other kid is upset. Afterall, they both want the toy. And so the war begins and they fight over the toy until their mother arrives with the ultimate prize. Icecream. <br><br> Life of Kids was selected to be on the <a href="https://commarts.wisc.edu/showcase/">2021-2022 Spring Communication Arts Showcase</a>. I want to give a quick shoutout to who made it possible - Kazoua, Ali, Bria and Professor Erik Gunneson and Zachary Zahos.

	<h2>My Edited Work for Com Arts 355: Untitled</h2>

			In Communication Arts 355: Introduction to Media Production, our task was to create our own screenplay anad film it. However, my class was during the time when the pandemic hit and so the class changed dramatically. We could no longer find actors to act for our plays, the campus was shutting down, and no one wanted to work together for their safety. <br><br> So CA355 transitioned to a new project: an Editing Comparison Project. We were given two files of two teams acting out the same script. Together, we had to edit both files individually and write an essay on why one team was better than the other and why it was easier to edit one over the other. <br><br> I present to you, Edited Scenes by Group B which was selected to be on the <a href="https://commarts.wisc.edu/showcase-spring2020/">2020-2021 Spring Communication Arts Showcase</a>. Shoutout to the ones who made it possible - the amazing actors and production team, Professor Aaron Granat, and Dillon Mitchell for teaching us and giving us the opportunity.

		This wonderful project called, No Son of Mine, is an already completed production and edited film by students of the University of Wisconsin - Madison. However, in Com Arts 465: Editing and Post-Production for Video and Film, I had the honor of re-editing scene six with my best interpretion and skill. <br><br> With no context, I had to reproduce a feeling of discomfort between two brothers while keeping the third brother relevant in this scene. While keeping track of the pacing and tension within their world, I also had to alter the audio to prevent overlap between the actors' lines. Shoutout to Erika Moulton for teaching me how to be a better editor.
