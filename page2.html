		<p id = "welcome">On this page you get to learn more my personal interests. I'll list my favorite books, experiences, and joys of my life. The reason why I am creating this page is because I find it really challenging to talk about my personal life. By the time you're a senior, it becomes ingrained to talk about your classes and your major. It's hard to have a normal fun conversation because I've become de-sensitized to the constant introductory of what my major is. So please enjoy additional fun facts about myself.</p>

			This is Sorbet. She is about 5 years old and she is a Lovebird. She and I have been on an adventure full of love and hate. And in our friendship, there were many things we learned about each other. <br><br> For example. when she squawks with her wings up, she's expressing happiness. When she grinds her beak, she's showing you how comfortable is with you. When she is making clicking noises and snapping her beak... it means she's not afraid to make you bleed. <br><br> And a heads up for everyone interested in a lovebird... every single one of them are cute, but they are extremely territorial and can be aggressive. Hence the many bloody fingers I've received while cleaning her cage.

			One of my favorite activities to do in the Madison area is to attend the local garden's light events. This is a structure from their light exhibit called GLEAM that was open earlier this fall. They were open from 7PM to 11PM with many light exhibits. <br><br> This particular structure was stunning as it was built and standing on one of Olbrich Garden's pond. I found the sea-blue light calming and glorious. I highly recommend attending Olbrich Garden's events as they occur all year round, such as their Butterfly exhibit and Orchid exhibit.

		This wonderful book is titled All Along You Were Blooming by Morgan Harper Nichols as well as illustrated by her too! The reason why I love this book is because it speaks to people who are lost, have anxiety, are depressed, who have overcome grief, and really, to the people who live to enderstand empathy. <br><br> A great summary of her book is the name of her title, "All Along You Were Blooming." Her beautiful words provide reassurance to her readers that they've grown a lot on their journey, but to also recognize that they are still growing and will always keep growing. And before you know it... <br><br>"All along you were blooming."
